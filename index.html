                <h2>What is Sickle Cell Disease?</h2>
                <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. 
                   Normal red blood cells are round and flexible, allowing them to move easily 
                   through blood vessels. In people with sickle cell disease, the red blood cells 
                   become rigid and shaped like a crescent moon or sickle, which causes them to 
                   get stuck in small blood vessels. This blocks the flow of oxygen to tissues, 
                   leading to pain and potential organ damage.
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Sickle Cell Disease</h2>
                <p>There are several types of sickle cell disease, including: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sickle Cell Anemia (HbSS): The most common and severe form of the disease, 
                        where the body produces only sickle-shaped red blood cells.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hemoglobin SC Disease (HbSC): A milder form of sickle cell disease, 
                        resulting from a mix of hemoglobin S (sickle-shaped cells) and hemoglobin C.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hemoglobin S Beta Thalassemia (HbS-β Thalassemia): A type of sickle cell 
                        disease where the patient has both sickle cells and beta-thalassemia traits.
                    </li>
                </ul>
